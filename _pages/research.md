My research primarily focuses on national identities and their relevance for political attitudes and voting behaviour.

In the spirit of transparent and replicable research, you can find the replication files of my articles on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/z26f9/). Feel free to use the material for secondary analyses, teaching or other purposes.
