Hi! I am a social scientist at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.

My research focuses on national identities, political attitudes, and the activation of social identities for political behaviour. I am also interested in data harmonisation and survey research. My research draws on pooled cross-sectional data, panel survey data, and experimental data.

I completed my PhD in October 2024 at the Chair of Political Sociology at the University of Bamberg. In my dissertation, I investigate whether far-right parties attract individuals with specific conceptions of nationality. I find that national identity affects voting, especially in times when national and immigration-related issues are at the forefront of public debate.
