To Draw a Line: National Identities and their Political Consequences. (*Dissertation*)
======

 Despite increased globalisation and growing international migration, nation states, nationalism, and national identification continue to play a crucial role in organising the world politically, economically, and socially. Particuarly, nationalist positions have recently regained ground dramatically in national politics. This recent resurgence and the successes of far-right parties emphasising national exclusivity (Mudde 2007; Halikiopoulou et al. 2013; Halikiopoulou and Vlandas 2019) demonstrate the continuing relevance of national identity for individuals. This relevance of the nation to the individual, and particularly the political consequences of this relevance, is the focus of my dissertation.

LORDpilot - Linked Open Research Data for Social Science Pilot Study 
======

 The ‘LORDpilot’ project evaluates the practicability of a Concept Registry for the social and economic sciences, develops a basic data model for the Concept Registry and a user-friendly application. To this end, exemplary for a selection of overlapping content of important data collections in the disciplines (ALLBUS, SOEP, Nacaps) concepts are identified, questions and variables are linked to the concepts, and relationships across the concepts between the data collections are established. Theoretical concepts are identified through intellectual analysis and comparison, as well as research on measurement tools and dataset-related publications.

 HaSpaD - Harmonizing and synthesizing partnership histories from different research data infrastructures: A model project for linking research data from various infrastructure
======
 
 This research project harmonises and cumulates survey-based, longitudinal data compiled from relationship biographies. By pooling these data sources, the project pursues two primary goals: First, utilising and improving contemporary research methods for data synthesis, this research project aimed to further increase the importance and visibility of evidence-based social science research. Second, the pooled data set allows to investigate previously unanswered questions regarding relationship stability from a historical and life-course perspective, for example concerning the reasons for the increase of divorce rates over the last decades and whether risk factors for separation have changed.

ONBound - Old and new boundaries: National Identities and Religion

 In times of globalization on the one hand, and growing divergence also within society e.g. in terms of wealth and life chances on the other hand, national and religious identities seem to re-gain salience as markers for exclusion, or inclusion, for a differentiation between "us" and "them". 
 The ONBound project seeks to increase the understanding of how national and religious identities are intertwined, or exclude each other, in the modern world. On this purpose, we browsed a vast array of existing individual level and contextual data and built a database that offers the opportunity for scientific research to explore these issues. Beyond individual-level survey data the database contains relevant country-level indicators for research questions on one or both topics.Due to copyright restrictions, researchers need to download the original datasets from the original sources. Thereupon, ONBound provides a set of customized syntax files for cumulation and harmonization of the data.
